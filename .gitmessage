# Git Commit Message Template for FreeTun

# Use this template for consistent commit messages

# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

# Type should be one of:
# - feat: A new feature
# - fix: A bug fix
# - docs: Documentation only changes
# - style: Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting)
# - refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# - perf: Code change that improves performance
# - test: Adding missing tests
# - chore: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

# Scope (optional): Indicate what part of the codebase you're working on
# - auth
# - user
# - project
# - payment
# - message
# - admin
# - frontend
# - backend

# Examples:
# feat(auth): implement user registration endpoint
# fix(payment): resolve escrow release timing issue
# docs: update setup instructions in README
# refactor(user): simplify profile update logic
# chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions

# Subject line rules:
# - Use imperative mood ("add" not "adds" or "added")
# - Don't capitalize first letter
# - No period at the end
# - Maximum 50 characters

# Body (optional): Explain what and why, not how
# - Wrap at 72 characters
# - Separate from subject with blank line

# Footer (optional): Reference issues
# - Closes #123
# - Fixes #456
# - Related to #789
